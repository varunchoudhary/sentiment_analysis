The electoral map. In the 6 presidential elections since 1992, the Democratic candidate has won 18 states + DC every time. That’s 242 total electoral votes. The Republican nominee has won 13 states in every one of those elections. That’s 102 electoral votes. If Clinton wins the 18 states + DC that every Democratic has won since 1992 AND she wins Florida (29 electoral votes) the election is over. She is president.
The demographics. Republicans had a demographic problem going into this election. They are facing down a demographic nightmare now. Mitt Romney won 27 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2012. Trump is, currently, doing half that well. Given the massive growth in the Hispanic community and the declining percentage of the white vote as a function of the total electorate, that’s a massive problem.
Donald Trump. Trump will get blamed more than he probably should if he loses on November 8. Trump hasn’t helped himself with his inflammatory rhetoric and unwillingness to stay on message of course.
After closely watching the GOP presidential debates, it's not hard to see that Donald Trump has been far more shrewd than his opponents have been giving him credit for. However, he isn't just playing loose with all the anti-hispanic and anti-immigrant stands - he has a plan and one can pick up patterns of it with some careful observation.If Donald Trump leads and ultimately becomes the GOP nominee, he's going to pick Ben Carson as his running mate. He's already said that he likes Ben Carson and is not going to campaign against him. Donald Trump is going for the African-American votes, a group that has traditionally been at loggerheads with the GOP. It shouldn't come as a surprise then that this also plays well with his rhetoric about illegal immigrants stealing american jobs, a theme that strongly resonates with the black community.
While Donald Trump might say that he will bring the Latino votes back, it looks unlikely that will be the case and deep down he knows it. He's really counting on the African American votes, a group that has traditionally been liberal and gone with the Democratic Party. If he can turn them around, he wouldn't need the hispanic votes.And unlike some people here who think he's too bombastic and will likely make himself a fool over the course of run up, I think the likelihood of that happening is not much different than for any other candidate. Think about it: while probably knowing the least of the specifics amongst all the candidates and not having any firm policy positions, he's faring much better than his competitors despite being under more scrutiny.So far, he's playing it smarter than any candidate imho and dominating the field. I would put his odds as 4:1, which is pretty good as there's so much time ahead of 2016.
I listened to his policies, did a ton of research and realized he was totally going in the wrong direction. Instead of fixing horrible problems and creating jobs, he would not only do the exact opposite but create a series of intractable problems that likely wouldn’t get resolved in this Century, if ever. That bad. I could single handedly rip all his ideas apart and show how they would not only fail conceptually but that he as the operator would fail to make them work because he doesn’t know operations. Government is all operations. He lost almost a billion $ personally due to his operational failures. Yikes, keep that man away from government that is WAAAY more difficult to operate than a private business where at least you as CEO can make things happen. Not so in government. Compromise, listen and empathize endlessly; he is unable to do either.His personal problems are just window dressing compared to his fundamental lack of understanding of how to solve any of the problems he calls a disaster.I now spend 4 hours per day responding to people, informing them of what is at stake and to prevent the biggest disaster we’ve faced since WWII. Even without his horrible position on women, he should still lose on basic merit alone. Please do your homework on this man who has less than 5% worldwide support but somehow has captured the heart of so many Americans for reasons I am trying to fathom.Will respond to all of your comments.A vision of the future Trump has no idea about since he’s trying to push us back to 20th century technology."]
It’s them against the world. And people who disagree with Trump or raise questions about things he said are part of the establishment that has failed up until now.
Trump didn’t create the racism, sexism, and xenophobia; he exploited it.
Let me be blunt. Quora tends to be anti-Trump because Quorans tend to be knowledgeable people who are good at critical thinking. Whether Trump should be President is not a matter of serious intellectual disagreement. In order to believe Trump should be President, you must be entirely unaware of what qualities make a person dangerous to have in any position of authority.
Trump is narcissistic and self-absorbed.Trump openly incites his followers to violence and pretends he had nothing to do with it when they commit violence on his orders.Trump throws tantrums when somebody says something negative about him and attempts to destroy them by any means necessary.Trump aggressively promotes stereotypes about minorities.Trump unapologetically associates with white supremacists.
Trump makes grandiose claims about what he will do as President, when the most cursory examination of the facts makes it clear he can never make good on those promises — unless he intends to nuke anybody who stands in his way.Trump says one thing on Monday and the opposite on Tuesday.Trump says things that are grossly, ridiculously false and defends them not with facts, but simply by pointing out that the crowd liked it when he said it.Saying “Trump would make a good President” is a lot like saying “I think my pet tapeworms are going to be good for my intestines.”
How can any legal immigrant to the US vote for Hillary Clinton?
She can’t handle classified information, takes money from countries that fund ISIS and behead LGBT, sells public offices to the highest payers, apparently hates average Americans (latest email leak), threatened women who had affair with her husband, and even called blacks “super predators”
I previously thought of Trump as incompetent and a joke.Now I see him as misogynistic, racist, ignorant, xenophobic, foolish, narcissistic, sadistic, elitist, arrogant, barbaric, lacking in all qualifications, a possible drug addict, and akin to Hitler in his regard for truth.I still see him as incompetent, but I no longer see him as a joke. Donald Trump is no joke. It helps to remember that people used to laugh at Hitler as a “little corporal.” People used to laugh at Idi Amin as a buffoon. No one is laughing now.I no longer see Trump as a joke.I see him as rotten to the core.The electoral map.
